# Project Portfolio: Comparison of Self-Reported and Actigraphy-Measured Physical Activity in People Living with HIV

## Overview
This project aimed to compare self-reported physical activity measures with actigraphy-measured physical activity in people living with HIV (PLWH). The study collected data from 103 patients in the PROSPER-HIV study and analyzed the relationship between the two measures using chance-corrected agreement methods. 

## Objectives
The main objectives of this project were:
- To assess the concordance between self-reported LRCQ and actigraphy-measured physical activity in PLWH.
- To evaluate the accuracy of self-reported physical activity measures compared to actigraphy.
- To determine if self-reported measures can be used as a reliable substitute for actigraphy in future studies.

## Methods
The study collected data from 103 patients in the PROSPER-HIV study. Participants wore an ActiGraph accelerometer for seven consecutive days to measure their physical activity levels. They also completed a self-reported Lipid Research Clinics Physical Activity Questionnaire (LRCQ) during the same period. The relationship between these two measures was analyzed using chance-corrected agreement methods, including Cohen's kappa statistic and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC).

## Results
The results showed that there was a moderate agreement between self-reported LRCQ and actigraphy-measured physical activity levels among PLWH. The Cohen's kappa statistic was 0.44 (95% CI: 0.28-0.60), indicating moderate agreement, while the ICC was 0.47 (95% CI: 0.29-0.63), indicating fair to good reliability.

However, there were significant differences between the two measures, with participants reporting higher levels of physical activity than what was measured by actigraphy. The mean difference between self-reported LRCQ and actigraphy-measured physical activity was 1,038 steps per day (95% CI: 563-1,513 steps per day). 

Subgroup analyses showed that participants who were older, had lower CD4 counts, or had higher viral loads tended to over-report their physical activity levels compared to what was measured by actigraphy.

## Conclusion
The study concluded that while there is moderate agreement between self-reported LRCQ and actigraphy-measured physical activity levels among PLWH, self-reported measures may not be a reliable substitute for actigraphy in future studies due to significant differences between the two measures. Researchers should consider using both methods to obtain a more accurate assessment of physical activity
